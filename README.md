# 4-bit Sequential Multiplier Simulation

This example implements a digital 4-bit sequential multiplier simulation on [SimulIDE](https://simulide.com/p/), it is composed by:

- 4-bit parallel input shift-right register (subcircuit)
- 4-bit parallel input 8-bit parallel output shift-left register (subcircuit)
- 8-bit parallel load register (subcircuit)
- 4-bit zero comparator
- 8-bit adder (subcircuit)
- FSM Finite State Machine as control block (script) [readme file](/FSM/README.md)
